# Zenith-OS
A linux distro built on busybox and python. Also uses Salam Package Manager.

# *DO NOT INSTALL THIS ON HARDWARE*

ZenithOS is not complete and because I am the only maintainer and I don't want to add repos, a billion packages, or to keep compiling for just a hobby OS
you would need to compile most packages yourself because I feel like it.

Although if you would like to there will be a installer script that copies everything from the live environment.

Anyways ZenithOS is a live OS that uses busybox, python, and the i3wm for stuff.

Currently python actually doesn't come with ZenithOS (ikr)
But it will be added so uh you can only install packages rather than ya'know search and update.
(Or I could use curl/wget)
